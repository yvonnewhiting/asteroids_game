ASTEROID GAME - STARTUP ROUTINE
===============================

Every time I start coding:

1. Open WSL terminal

2. Activate virtual environment:
   source asteroid-game/bin/activate
   (Look for "(asteroid-game)" at start of prompt)

3. Go to project folder:
   cd asteroids_game

4. Ready to code!

BACKUP ROUTINE:
- git add .
- git commit -m "describe changes"
- git push

DON'T FORGET TO PUSH! (That's what went wrong last time)
